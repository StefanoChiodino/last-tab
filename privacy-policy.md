Last Tab does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data.

The extension tracks only tab IDs (numeric identifiers) in local memory to switch between your two most recent tabs. This data is never persisted to disk, sent to any server, or shared with any third party.

No analytics, cookies, or tracking of any kind is used.
